# Simple Task Planner

This is a basic full-stack web app to keep track of tasks.  
It uses **Python (Flask)** for the backend (with a springle of SQLite) and **plain HTML/CSS/JS** for the frontend.

Your tasks are stored in a local **SQLite** database file (`tasks.db`).
If the website is running, you can [test out the program here](https://task-planner-qk8c.onrender.com) without having to download and build it yourself.
